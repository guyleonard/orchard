Updates
=======
This is going to be a full re-write of the "'Darren's Orchard'" Pipeline.

I am going to attempt to pull most of the scripts in to the main script.

I am also going to release this version with a Licence. For the moment, before public release, I have include GNU GPL V3.0, but this may change before the first public release...
